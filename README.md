# me477_repo
This is a repository by Christian Merrikin, a student of Saint Martin's School of Engineering. Spring semester, 2020.
## Background:
### Course Description
ME477 is a course in embeded computing utilizing C code on the MyRio platform. In case you have not 
heard, there was a COVID-19 epidemic that shut down many aspects of civilized life in the U.S., 
including all in-person acedemic activities. Therefore, because it was not feasible to continue
the ACTUAL ME477 coursework, the second half of the course focussed on an introduction to the 
ROS system.
### Course Details
This course was taught by Dr. Rico Picone. Much of his teaching material can be found on his [webpage](http://ricopic.one/courses/robotics_mini_course).
Written on an Ubuntu virtual computer the ROS packages enclosed in this repository are written with Python.
### Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the understanding of the basic ROS structure and functionality. It is the 
final project for the ME477 course.
## ROS Packages:
There are three ROS packages included in this repository. The details for **merrikin_actions**, **merrikin_services**, and **merrikin_topics** are listed below.
### Requirements
To best run these ROS packages utilize a computer with the Ubuntu_18.04.4_LTE operating system installed. The ROS program is largely interfaced with through the Bash shell terminal. 
#### Operating System: [Ubuntu 18.04 LTS](https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop)
#### ROS Version: [Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic)
#### Python Version: [2.7.17](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2717/)
